0.5.0
-----
1. Convert to Python3, for compatability with Ubuntu 12.10

0.4.0
-----
 1. Add a simple log file viewer.
 2. Save profiles into /etc/kcm_ufw - this way they are system-wide.
 3. Store rule descriptions in /etc/kcm_ufw, as they are part of this
    kcm, not ufw itself.
 4. Block further actions, until current one is complete.
 5. Set size of policy combos in simple and advanced pages to the
    same size - to mimimize flicker. (Not sure why they have
    different sizes.)
 6. Make text field of simple port the same size as the combo.
 7. Change column order of rules list to "Action, From, To, ..."
 8. Make 'Add Rule' dialog non-modal, so that 'Log Viewer' and

    defined, that these will be removed.
 8. Can only define one interface per rule - not seperate source
    and destination.

    firewall status), and as a background pixmap in add/edit dialog.
11. Only set rules list column sizes after first non-empty list.
12. Add a cmake option UFW_TRANSLATIONS, used to specify which
    translations should be built and installed. e.g.
